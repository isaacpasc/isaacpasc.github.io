			    <p>During my time at Expedia, I gained valuable experience across various roles, starting as a Software Engineer Intern and progressing to Software Engineer II. 
			
			        As a <strong>Software Engineer Intern (May 2022 - July 2022)</strong>, I collaborated with an iOS Development team based in Gurgaon, India, where I helped build scalable and reusable components using SwiftUI and UIKit. I integrated Apollo GraphQL for SDUI, ensuring high code quality with comprehensive unit and UI testing, which improved maintainability. I also contributed to the <strong>EG Global Hackathon</strong>, where my team won the "Share the Love" category by developing innovative features using Apple's SharePlay API, demonstrating both creativity and technical skill. Additionally, I developed a dynamic carousel component for the activities page, enhancing user engagement by showcasing related travel activities.
			
			        In my role as <strong>Software Engineer I (Aug 2023 - Aug 2024)</strong>, I worked on full-stack solutions using technologies such as GraphQL, Node.js, TypeScript, Java, and React. I contributed to a robust and scalable property onboarding system that enhanced both user experience and operational efficiency. I also led the implementation of a rate automation system, optimizing rate management, partner enrollment, and driving increased bookings and revenue. In addition, I spearheaded security enhancements by upgrading Java and Node.js versions and patching vulnerabilities, ensuring system security and compliance with the latest standards. I also mentored an intern, guiding them through the successful migration of a legacy onboarding page to a new platform.
			
			        As a <strong>Software Engineer II (Aug 2024 - Present)</strong>, I enhanced unified navigation and state management, making cross-platform navigation more robust and consistent, leading to an improved user experience. I also led the initiative to address EU accessibility compliance issues within tight deadlines, ensuring regulatory adherence. To improve maintainability and debugging, I enhanced logging efficiency in our Java Spring application by implementing Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). Additionally, I leveraged the Shadow DOM to streamline the migration of legacy pages, improving both system performance and maintainability.</p>
