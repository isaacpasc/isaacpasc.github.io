			<!-- My Spot -->
			<div class="point" id="myspot">
				<h2>My Spot</h2>
				<span><img src="images/icon.png" alt="My Spot Logo" /></span>
				<p>My Spot is my most ambitious project to date! This app is available on iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS and boasts a range of features such as widgets, notifications (with service/content extensions), iMessage app, and AppClip.

					My Spot is a unique social media app that revolves around location-based sharing. Built using various Apple frameworks, My Spot is primarily based on the SwiftUI lifecycle, but also makes use of several key UIKit features. Some of the frameworks that were utilized during the development process include Cloudkit, CoreData, CoreML, Admob, Combine, Firebase, Revenue Cat, and many others.
					
					To learn more about My Spot and the technology behind it, please visit the <a href="https://myspotexploration.com" target="_blank">official My Spot website</a>. Here you'll find a detailed breakdown of all the app's features and the technologies that make it possible. Alternatively, you can find My Spot on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-spot-exploration/id1613618373" target="_blank">AppStore</a> and start exploring its many capabilities today.</p>

			<!-- Ask AI -->
			<div class="point" id="askai">
				<h2>Ask AI</h2>
				<span><img src="images/logo_with_color.png" alt="Ask AI" /></span>
				<p>Ask AI is an innovative AI chatbot that utilizes a range of cutting-edge technologies to provide you with the answers you need. Built with Firebase, GPT-3.5 turbo, Cloudkit, CoreData, Admob, and Revenue Cat. This app uses Firebase for analytics, Firestore database, authentication, app attest, remote config, crashlytics, and cloud functions to ensure seamless performance. By leveraging the power of Open AI GPT-3.5 turbo model api, Ask AI is able to provide comprehensive answers to a wide range of questions. The app also features a unique typing effect from the AI, made possible through server-sent events for faster responses. Authentication is done through Sign in with Apple, with cloud functions available to revoke authentication tokens as needed. This app is available on all devices: watchOS, tvOS, macOS, iOS, iMessages, widgets, siri, shortcuts, app intents, and many more! Ask AI is more than just a chatbot, it uses several other technologies to let users do some amazing things. Be sure to check out the incredible features added to this app! Visit the <a href="https://ask-ai-chatbot.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Ask AI official website</a> to learn more about the technologies used in this project, or check it out on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ask-ai-free-gpt-chat-bot/id1671670609" target="_blank">AppStore</a>.</p>

			<!-- Dashify -->
			<div class="point" id="dashify">
				<h2>Dashify</h2>
				<span><img src="images/dashifyCircleD.png" alt="Dashify Logo" /></span>
				<p>Dashify is an iOS client that is designed to work seamlessly with the popular web hosting service, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. Through the development process, I gained valuable experience in creating generic api calls with async/await and combine, as well as authentication and preventing CSRF attacks. The project also made use of WebViews with javascript and keychain to securely store login tokens.

					The login process for Dashify is powered by a WebView, providing Netlify users with a streamlined login experience. The use of WebViews allowed for a seamless integration of the Netlify login screen into the app, while ensuring the authentication process is as secure as possible.
					
					For more information about Dashify, its features, and the technology that makes it possible, please visit the <a href="https://dashifyios.netlify.app" target="_blank">official Dashify website</a>. Alternatively, you can find Dashify on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dashify-manage-your-website/id6443705790" target="_blank">AppStore</a> and start exploring the many benefits it offers to Netlify users.</p>

			<!-- Food Bot -->
			<div class="point" id="foodbot">
				<h2>Food Bot</h2>
				<span><img src="images/foodbotlogonogb.png" alt="Food Bot Logo" /></span>
				<p>Food Bot is a unique app that I created to make the process of filling out restaurant surveys a breeze! Through the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in integrating javascript with WKWebView for two-way communication, as well as using CloudKit to build a sleek and intuitive user interface.

					Food Bot simplifies the process of filling out restaurant surveys by automatically populating the necessary fields in exchange for rewards such as free food items. The app also uses a range of cutting-edge technologies such as AVCapture, Machine Learning, and regular expressions to scrape survey codes off of receipts, further streamlining the survey process for users.

Here, you'll find a detailed breakdown of the app's features and the technologies used to create it. Alternatively, you can find Food Bot on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/food-bot-survey-filler/id6444194042" target="_blank">AppStore</a> and start taking advantage of its many time-saving benefits today.

			<!-- News App -->
			<div class="point" id="news">
				<h2>News App</h2>
				<span><img src="images/news.jpg" alt="News Logo" /></span>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacpasc/SwiftBasics-UIkit-And-SwiftUI" target="_blank">News App</a> is an iOS application designed to help users easily find relevant news articles. I created this app twice, once in SwiftUI and once in UIKit, leveraging key Swift fundamentals that are essential for success in building large-scale applications.

					The app includes a range of advanced features such as protocols, delegate patterns, image caching, and generic API calls with Combine. Additionally, it implements pagination, TableView/ListView, and many more features that have helped to establish it as a powerful and versatile tool.

			<!-- Data Query -->
			<div class="point" id="querydata">
				<h2>Data Query</h2>
				<span><img src="images/dfs.jpg" alt="Graph Logo" /></span>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacpasc/compressionAlgorithm" target="_blank">Data Query</a> is a command-line application created using C++. This application is designed to query large files based on parameters, and it employs several custom-made data structures, with no libraries involved.

					These data structures include hashtables, Binary Search Trees, and graphs in adjacency list form. Moreover, Data Query utilizes the Floyd Warshall Algorithm and DFS algorithms to traverse these structures, without any external libraries.
			</div>

			<!-- Compression Algorithm -->
			<div class="point" id="compression">
				<h2>Compression Algorithm</h2>
				<span><img src="images/compress.jpg" alt="Compress Logo" /></span>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacpasc/graphQueries" target="_blank">Compression Algorithm</a> is a command-line tool built in C++ with a Makefile that allows for the encoding or decoding of any ASCII text file. The tool uses either insertion sort or merge sort algorithms to build a binary search tree, which is then traversed to encode or decode the file. This project showcases my skills in developing efficient and effective algorithms in C++, as well as my ability to create and manage complex software projects.</p>
