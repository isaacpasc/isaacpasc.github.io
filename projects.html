			<!-- My Spot -->
			<div class="point" id="myspot">
				<h2>My Spot</h2>
				<span><img src="images/icon.png" alt="My Spot Logo" /></span>
				<p>My Spot is my most ambitious project yet! It's an iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS app with widgets, 
					notifications (with service/content extensions), iMessage app, AppClip, and much more. My Spot 
					is a social media app centered around locations. It uses many Apple frameworks and runs mainly in 
					the SwiftUI lifecycle but also utilizes many UIKit features. Some frameworks used include: Cloudkit, CoreData, CoreML, and Combine. 
					For more information please visit the 
					<a href="https://myspotexploration.com" target="_blank">My Spot Offical Website</a> which goes in depth on technologies 
					used and all of its features or find it on the 
					<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-spot-exploration/id1613618373" target="_blank">AppStore</a>.</p>

			<!-- Dashify -->
			<div class="point" id="dashify">
				<h2>Dashify</h2>
				<span><img src="images/dashifyCircleD.png" alt="Dashify Logo" /></span>
				<p>Dashify is an ios client for web hosting service, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>. In this project I learned to create generic api calls with async/await and combine, authentication and preventing CSRF attacks, and WebViews with javascript. The project also uses keychain to store login tokens.
					The login process for Dashify uses a WebView to present a login screen for Netlify users. This WebView had some challenges to properly confrom to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" target="_blank">AppStore Review Guidelines</a>. One issue was that Netlify offers a 'Pro' plan but Dashify does not offer an in-app-purchase method for buying this subscription. The only way around this rule is a 'free standalone app acting as a stand-alone companion to a paid web based tool'.
					The only issue here is that there must be not one call to action to purchase a 'Pro' Netlify account from within Dashify. This meant that I had to lock down the login experience in Dashify to only show exactly what I want and nothing more. I was able to inject javascript at the end of each document to successfully remove all upgrade buttons. And if the user
					 ever tries to leave the login process, the WebView will clear all cookies to sign them out and send them back to login.

			<!-- News App -->
			<div class="point" id="news">
				<h2>News App</h2>
				<span><img src="images/news.jpg" alt="News Logo" /></span>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacpasc/SwiftBasics-UIkit-And-SwiftUI" target="_blank">News App</a> is 
					is an ios app that allows users to search for relevant news articles. News app was made twice, once in 
					SwiftUI and once in UIKit. It features many swift fundementals that are key for success in large 
					scale applications. These fundementals include: protocals, delegate pattern, image caching, 
					generic api calls with combine, pagination, TableView/ListView, and much more!</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Data Query -->
			<div class="point" id="querydata">
				<h2>Data Query</h2>
				<span><img src="images/dfs.jpg" alt="Graph Logo" /></span>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacpasc/compressionAlgorithm" target="_blank">Data Query</a> is 
					a command line application using c++ with a Makefile. It querys large css files based on parameters. These queries 
					use several data structures (custom made, no libraries) such as hashtables, BST, and graphs in adjacency list. These data 
					structes are traversed using Floyd Warshall Algorithm and DFS (again, no libraries are used).</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Compression Algorithm -->
			<div class="point" id="compression">
				<h2>Compression Algorithm</h2>
				<span><img src="images/compress.jpg" alt="Compress Logo" /></span>
				<p><a href="https://github.com/isaacpasc/graphQueries" target="_blank">Compression Algorithm</a> is 
					a command line application using c++ with a Makefile. It encodes or decodes any text file with ASCII 
					characters by using either insertion sort or merge sort to build a binary search tree and traverse the tree to 
					encode/decode.</p>
