				<h2>Create Spots</h2>
				<div class="portrait">
					<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/duOKP6S8D0E" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<p>To begin creating your first spot, tap the plus button. All spots require at least one image and a name. Setting a spot to public will save it locally and to the cloud where other users can find it. Adding a description is optional and using a hashtag in front of a word will create a tag. Then add up to three photos from photo gallery or camera. You can also change the location by tapping the map button and then selecting the man with his hand raised, this changes the spot to use a custom location. Custom locations can be saved by simply moving the map to a location, entering custom coordinates, or searching a location. The arrow button on the map moves the screen to your location (if location services are enabled for My Spot) and the squares button changes the map to satelite view. After saving the location, you will see the location name change at the top of the screen. You can also tap the calender button to set a date found for the spot. when you're done, tap save and you'll see a progress bar at the bottom indicating when the spot will be processed. All spots can be edited or deleted, both public spots and local spots. And all local spots are saved to your iCloud account, meaning you can download My Spot on another device (that is signed in to the same iCloud account) and all your spots will be synced across devices and backed up to your personal iCloud storage.</p>

			<!--View Spots in Detail-->

				<p>My Spot offers a powerful way to interact with spots. The top section shows images of the spot and with a tap of the arrows button, you can zoom in to each image and get a closer look. Tapping the share button in the top left brings up a share sheet to send the spot to friends. Tap the cloud button in the middle to download the spot and save it locally (if the spot is yours, this will be an edit button). Tapping the up arrow will enlarge the bottom sheet for easy access. If the spot has a description, tapping the spot name (heading area) will open a small sheet with the description and a button to copy it to clipboard. Tap the spot creator's account to open their account in detail. Tap the map to show a map sheet with the spot location and button overlays to show satelite view or get directions. Tap weather (iOS 16 only) to get a detailed weather report for the current day or up to ten days in the future. Tap comments button to share your thoughts on the spot. In the comments section, tap and hold on a comment to report it, tap the thumbs up button to like it, or tap the trash button to delete any comments you have made.

Any social media such as tiktok, youtube, or instagram can be connected to your account so users who find your account can also find your other social media. Accounts can be shared by tapping the share button in the top right.

Subscribe to comments to be notified when a new comment has been made on one of your spots. Subscribe to News and Updates to recieve notifications personalized by yours truly (don't worry I won't spam these and only important updates are shared). And on any account page, tap the subscribe button to be notified when that user has posted a new spot. When you recieve a new comment notification, you can either tap it to open the spot that recieved a new comment, or press and hold the notification to reply directly in the notification (similar to iMessage).

The owner can set permissions for each participent or stop sharing entiely at any time. If notifications are enabled for shared playlists, you will be updated once any changes occur. The spots in a playlist tab behave similar to spots in the My Spot tab, tap the map button to see all playlist spots in the map, search for spots in the playlist, or sort them.

When the operating system believes you have traveled a substantial distance, the widget will be updated to show relevant spots based on your new location. Tap on the spot in the widget to open it up in the app or tap on any surrounding area to open the app without a spot. Press and hold on the widget to access its settings. In settings you can allow for your owned spots to appear in the widget by toggling on "show my spots".

			<!--Machine Learning-->
			<div class="point" id="ml">
				<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
				<div class="portrait">
					<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/QCpKpwtHZUA" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<p>My Spot uses several machine learning models to help you find the spots you're looking for quickly and easily. In this video example I create a spot with no description and just a name of "Blank". I add a picture of my dog (a pug) and save it. Now when I search for pug, My Spot is smart and shows you this new spot called "Blank" because a pug was found in the image. This is very useful for finding all sorts of spots. For example, if a skateboard is present in the photo, all you need to do is search skate and that spot will appear in the search. My Spot also uses a NSFW model to filter out all potentially unsafe images (this applies only to public spots, all locally saved spots are not filtered). If your public spot image was removed and replaced with an eye with a line through it, this means My Spot deemed this photo inappropriate.</p>
			</div>

			<!--Hide Spots-->
			<div class="point" id="hidespots">
				<h2>Hide Spots</h2>
				<div class="portrait">
					<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/93jt32PSft8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<p>In order to hide a spot, two conditions need to be met. First, the spot must be private, and second, your device must have either Face ID, Touch ID, or any other password enabled (devices with no password to unlock will not be able to use this feature). After meeting these conditions, head over to the spot you would like to hide and tap on it for a detailed view. Scroll to the bottom and tap hide, if your device uses Face ID or Touch ID, you will be asked for permission then required to scan your face/finger. If your device has neither but uses a normal password, you will be asked to enter the password. Once successful, your spot is now hidden and every time it is accessed you will be required to use your authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, or password).</p>
			</div>

			<!--Advanced Sharing-->
			<div class="point" id="sharing">
				<h2>Advanced Sharing</h2>
				<div class="portrait">
					<iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/tN5SZsU4f_c" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				</div>
				<p>My Spot offers many ways to share Accounts and Spots. Account can be shared by tapping the share button in an account view and sending a link, or by tapping the profile image to reveal a scannable QR code. Spots can be shared by tapping the share button to send a link, tapping generate QR code to generate a QR code, or by tapping save to nfc to save the url to an nfc tag. The advanced part comes when someone uses the shared link/qr code/nfc tag. If the person who uses the link for any spot/account has the My Spot app, it will simply launch the app and show them the spot/account you sent. But, if they don't have the app and they are running ios 16 or greater, they will be presented with an AppClip card. Once they open the AppClip, they will be shown the account/spot that you have shared. This is huge! <b>Now people who just want to view the spot/account and do not want to download the full app can simply open the spot/account in the AppClip with one tap!</b> Anyone who opens the spot/account link and does not have My Spot installed and is not running ios 16 or greater, will be sent to the Appstore to download the full app. Please watch the demo video for more details.</p>
