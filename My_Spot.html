											<h2>What is My Spot</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My Spot allows you to find and share spots that have yet to be explored. Create, like and share spots with friends. Discover new spots in your area and explore the world! And now build playlists with friends too!</p>

											<h2>Why My Spot</h2>
										</header>
										<p>As a skater, I found it difficult to find spots in my area to skate at. No skateparks are near me and it was nearly impossible to simply Google skating spots. I also found it difficult to find decent cliff jumping spots at my local lake. This is why I created My Spot. You may be a hiker, mountain climber, bird watcher, mountain biker, etc. or all the above. My Spot will help you find exactly what you are looking for. Even if you are just someone looking for a quiet place to watch the sunset, My Spot is for you!</p>

											<h2>Create Spots</h2>
										</header>
										<p>To begin creating your first spot, tap the plus button. All spots require at least one image and a name. Setting a spot to public will save it locally and to the cloud where other users can find it. Adding a description is optional and using a hashtag in front of a word will create a tag. Then add up to three photos from photo gallery or camera. You can also change the location by tapping the map button and then selecting the man with his hand raised, this changes the spot to use a custom location. Custom locations can be saved by simply moving the map to a location, entering custom coordinates, or searching a location. The arrow button on the map moves the screen to your location (if location services are enabled for My Spot) and the squares button changes the map to satelite view. After saving the location, you will see the location name change at the top of the screen. You can also tap the calender button to set a date found for the spot. when you're done, tap save and you'll see a progress bar at the bottom indicating when the spot will be processed. All spots can be edited or deleted, both public spots and local spots. And all local spots are saved to your iCloud account, meaning you can download My Spot on another device (that is signed in to the same iCloud account) and all your spots will be synced across devices and backed up to your personal iCloud storage.</p>

											<h2>View Spots in Detail</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My Spot offers a powerful way to interact with spots. The top section shows images of the spot and with a tap of the arrows button, you can zoom in to each image and get a closer look. Tapping the share button in the top left brings up a share sheet to send the spot to friends. Tap the cloud button in the middle to download the spot and save it locally (if the spot is yours, this will be an edit button). Tapping the up arrow will enlarge the bottom sheet for easy access. If the spot has a description, tapping the spot name (heading area) will open a small sheet with the description and a button to copy it to clipboard. Tap the spot creator's account to open their account in detail. Tap the map to show a map sheet with the spot location and button overlays to show satelite view or get directions. Tap weather (iOS 16 only) to get a detailed weather report for the current day or up to ten days in the future. Tap comments button to share your thoughts on the spot. In the comments section, tap and hold on a comment to report it, tap the thumbs up button to like it, or tap the trash button to delete any comments you have made. Tap add event to save a calender event with the spot's name and location. And finally, tap the report button if the spot is at all inappropriate.</p>

											<h2>Discover Spots</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In the Discover tab, you can find any spots posted on My Spot. In the top left, you can tap the filter button to filter spots by most downloads, newest, closest (location is set by your location or a location selected in the map), or name. Tap the globe in the top left to narrow down the distance you would like to search. To search for specific spots, tap the search bar, type your search, then hit search. Tap the map to show all searched spots in a map and swipe spots at the bottom to move to the next spot. Tap search here to move your search location elsewhere. The map also allows you to view in satelite mode, get directions, or move to your current location. While in the discover tab, you can swipe to the left to search for users as well.</p>

											<h2>Personalize Your Account</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Upon starting My Spot for the first time, you will be asked to create an account. Only a name is required and all other fields are optional. No password is required as all accounts are linked to your iCloud account. This means as long as you are signed in to the iCloud account you used to create your My Spot account, you will automatically be logged in. Accounts can be edited at any time or deleted entirely by going to settings and tapping "delete account". Any social media such as tiktok, youtube, or instagram can be connected to your account so users who find your account can also find your other social media. Accounts can be shared by tapping the share button in the top right. Badges will also appear for all accounts that include recognition for certain categories such as having a high number of downloads, or being the first to post a spot in your area.</p>

											<h2>Notifications</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My Spot uses a powerful notification system to allow for many types of interactive notifications. To find all the notifications you are subscribed to, head to settings and tap notifications. Or go to the settings app > My Spot > notifications and tap the button at the bottom to open notification settings in My Spot. Subscribe to new spots to be notified when a new spot has been added to a location of your choice. Subscribe to shared playlists to be notified when one of your shared playlists has been changed (new name or new spots added). Subscribe to comments to be notified when a new comment has been made on one of your spots. Subscribe to News and Updates to recieve notifications personalized by yours truly (don't worry I won't spam these and only important updates are shared). And on any account page, tap the subscribe button to be notified when that user has posted a new spot. When you recieve a new comment notification, you can either tap it to open the spot that recieved a new comment, or press and hold the notification to reply directly in the notification (similar to iMessage). When you recieve a notification regarding a new spot, tap it to open the spot or press and hold to see a detailed description of the spot directly in the notification.</p>

											<h2>Shared Playlists</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In the playlist tab, you can create a playlist by tapping the plus in the top right corner and giving the playlist a name and an emoji. Then add any spots you have saved locally to the playlist. If you would like to share this playlist, you can add multiple friends to your playlist by tapping the person icon in the top left corner. This works similar to shared notes or shared photo albums. When one person in the shared playlists adds a spot or changes the name, it will update for all users. The owner can set permissions for each participent or stop sharing entiely at any time. If notifications are enabled for shared playlists, you will be updated once any changes occur. The spots in a playlist tab behave similar to spots in the My Spot tab, tap the map button to see all playlist spots in the map, search for spots in the playlist, or sort them.</p>

											<h2>iMessage App</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Use the iMessage app to send spots to friends in the message app. All public spots on your account will appear, just tap the spot to add it to your message. The message will contain a picture of the spot, the name, and the location name. If the recipient has the My Spot app as well, they will see the message exactly the same. When the message is tapped, it will open My Spot and reveal the spot. </p>

											<h2>Widgets</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Add a widget to your homescreen by pressing and holding on the home screen to enter editing mode and tap the plus button in the upper right corner. Then search for My Spot and select one of the three sizes of My Spot widgets. These widgets will ask for your location and once granted, the widget will find the closest spots to you (that are not owned by you). The location name will appear in the top and depending on the size of the widget, up to four spots will appear. When the operating system believes you have traveled a substantial distance, the widget will be updated to show relevant spots based on your new location. Tap on the spot in the widget to open it up in the app or tap on any surrounding area to open the app without a spot. Press and hold on the widget to access its settings. In settings you can allow for your owned spots to appear in the widget by toggling on "show my spots". You can also set a custom location by toggling on "custom location" and tapping "choose" to search for a location.</p>

											<h2>AppClip</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-app-clips-iphb3a73ec53/ios" target="_blank">AppClips</a> allow you to use My Spot to discover spots, without even downloading the app! The My Spot AppClip is iOS 16 only and lets you use the discover tab exactly the same as the main My Spot app. After a few searches you will be prompted to install the main app but this is optional, you can keep using the AppClip for as long as you would like. This AppClip can be useful for finding a certain spots in a pinch without taking precious iPhone storage and homescreen space. It is a very quick and convenient way to access My Spot and can be done through links, NFC tags, or scannable codes.</p>

											<h2>Vote on Spots with SharePlay</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Stuck at home and don't know what to do? Vote on your favorite spots with friends to plan out your day. While on a facetime call (audio or video and with any number of people) open up My Spot and go to discover tab. From there tap the SharePlay button in the bottom left corner and set the number of spots you would like to vote on. The spots chosen are directly from the filters you have already set, meaning you can filter spots any way you want and from any location in the discover tab then start the shareplay to set the spots you want. You will be asked to start the SharePlay and once it has started all participents in the facetime call will be notified to join if they would like to. Each participent is shown the same spots in the same order. Tap on the spot to view it in detail and get a better idea of its contents, swipe left to dislike the spot, swipe right to like it, and tap the back button at the bottom to undo your last vote. Once a participent likes/dislikes a spot, all other participents get updated and see in real time the vote counts. Once the voting has finished, you will see a list of all spots voted on and from there you can find the spots with the most likes and plan your day!</p>

											<h2>Shortcuts</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My Spot offers several powerful ways to interact with the app without opening it. From the homescreen, swipe down to open Spotlight Search then enter the name of any locally saved spot. Your spot will appear right inside of Spotlight Search with the image and description. Tap the arrow button to open directions and tap the spot to open it up in the app. Press and hold the My Spot app on the homescreen to open up several shortcuts. Tap "Discover Spots" to open up the app in the discover tab and start a search, tap "Create Spot" to open up the app and immediately create a new spot, and tap "Notifications" to open the notification sheet and view your latest notifications. Lastly, you can also go to the shortcuts app and search for My Spot. There you will find two shortcuts, one for discovering new spots, and one for creating spots.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My Spot uses several machine learning models to help you find the spots you're looking for quickly and easily. In this video example I create a spot with no description and just a name of "Blank". I add a picture of my dog (a pug) and save it. Now when I search for pug, My Spot is smart and shows you this new spot called "Blank" because a pug was found in the image. This is very useful for finding all sorts of spots. For example, if a skateboard is present in the photo, all you need to do is search skate and that spot will appear in the search. My Spot also uses a NSFW model to filter out all potentially unsafe images (this applies only to public spots, all locally saved spots are not filtered). If your public spot image was removed and replaced with an eye with a line through it, this means My Spot deemed this photo inappropriate.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<header>
											<h2>Hide Spots</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In order to hide a spot, two conditions need to be met. First, the spot must be private, and second, your device must have either Face ID, Touch ID, or any other password enabled (devices with no password to unlock will not be able to use this feature). After meeting these conditions, head over to the spot you would like to hide and tap on it for a detailed view. Scroll to the bottom and tap hide, if your device uses Face ID or Touch ID, you will be asked for permission then required to scan your face/finger. If your device has neither but uses a normal password, you will be asked to enter the password. Once successful, your spot is now hidden and every time it is accessed you will be required to use your authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, or password).</p>

									<div class="content">
										<header>
											<h2>SwiftUI</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" target="_blank">SwiftUI</a> is Apple's declaritive UI framework and its used all throughout My Spot. My Spot is built on SwiftUI and requires much less code than its UI counterpart, UIKit. SwiftUI aslo made it much easier to target multiple apps in the same project. For example, the AppClipp extension uses the axact same files that the main app uses, making it much easier to manage and maintain both apps.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>UIKit</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit" target="_blank">UIKit</a> is Apple's imperative UI framework that offers much greater support for legacy features due to its longer life compared to the newer SwiftUI. UIKit was used many times throughout My Spot to enable features such as maps with greater flexability, share sheets, and much more. The iMessage app was built entirely in the UIKit lifesycle, of course without storyboards because no one wants to mess with that on a large scale project.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Cloudkit</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/" target="_blank">Cloudkit</a> is Apple's BAS (backend as a service) framework that manages all of My Spot's backend. The reason I chose Cloudkit is its price... Free! It is limited to only ios or javascript deployment but this project was made with only ios development in mind so this service fit perfectly. It does have charges that can come up but the limits are far from what My Spot will ever reach. Its services also itegrate very well with ios applications. While it can be limiting in some ways, it works very well for My Spot. Cloudkit is used for shared playlists, backing up spots to personal iCloud storage, syncing spots across devices, push notifications, and of course nearly every process under the hood in the discover tab. It is also very secure and private to keep the user's mind at ease when it comes to their personal data.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>CoreData</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata" target="_blank">CoreData</a> is Apple's device storage framework that is used as the backbone of My Spot when it comes to managing data. I'll admit that CoreData was quite a learning curve and can become very complex with object graphs and persistant stores. My Spot uses two persistant stores, one for shared data and one for private data. My Spot uses NSPersistantCloudKitContainer (yeah that's a mouthful) to effortlessly sync up Cloudkit with CoreData to cretae a seemless experience for the user. My Spot also takes advantage of CoreSpotlight which indexes CoreData to be searched for in Spotlight Search. The object graph for My Spot is fairly simple with spots that can point to a parent playlist and playlists that can point to many spots (the graph is more complex when it comes to public data such as accounts, comments, etc.).</p>

											<h2>CoreML</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml" target="_blank">CoreML</a> is Apple's machine learning framework that goes hand to hand with VisionKit. These frameworks together allow My Spot to make predictions on what is in each image associated with a spot. It is also used as a filter in My Spot to remove sensitive images before they are uploaded. Its models have the benefit of being very small in size (relatively speaking) as they only store relationships.</p>
									</div>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/CoreML.png" alt="My Spot Logo" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<div class="content">
										<header>
											<h2>Notifications</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My Spot subscribes to changes in a certain database in CloudKit and handles those notifications with the use of two extensions, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension" target="_blank">UNNotificationServiceExtension</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotificationsui/unnotificationcontentextension" target="_blank">UNNotificationContentExtension</a>. The service extension acts first when a notification is recieved, it parses the data sent (data is sent with a mutable flag) and finds the correct ids it needs to fetch more data such as images or text and when it's ready, notifies the user. Then when the user taps and holds on the notification, the content extension comes to play. The content extension handles the view that should be displayed to the user. In the context of a spot notification, it first recieves the image and text data from the service extension then uses that data to build the view. In a new comment context, the content extension also shows a text field with a send button that the user can type in to quickly reply to a comment without even opening the app.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Localization</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My Spot is localized to 12 regions including: English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, and Ukrainian. These localizations are across the entire app including Info.plist, Intents file, and of course the app's content itself (all targets). Each localization is done throught Google translate (yes it's inaccurate in most situations) and then translated once more by some of my good bilingual friends. However, I don't recieve help for every localized region, meaning some regions are not yet guaranteed to be perfectly translated. If you find any errors in translations, please check out this <a href="https://github.com/isaacpasc/myspotlocal" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> with all of the .string files used to localize My Spot, and make a pull request to fix those errors.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Combine</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine" target="_blank">Combine</a> is Apple's declaritive Swift api that is used all throughout My Spot. It is particularly useful when it comes to upholding the MVVM architecture. I have built My Spot to use view model objects to build and manage the data of each view with dependency injection. Combine offers a powerful way to react to changes asynchronously. After reafactoring my code to use combine, I have dramatically increased readability and reusability, while also dramatically decreasing the clutter in each view.</p>

											<h2>Group Activities</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/GroupActivities" target="_blank">Group Activities</a> is Apple's framework that enables SharePlay in My Spot. Group Activites offers an observer object to make it easy to decide if a device is compatible to start a SharePlay (in an active facetime call). If it is compatible, My Spot shows a SharePlay button in the discover tab to begin a session to vote on spots. In the SharePlay metadata, the ActivityType is set to generic (SharePlay is typically used to sync media in a facetime call but genreic allows for any type of synced experience across devices). A Codable object is passed around to each participant, updating them on the status of all other participants. If a new participant joins late, they are immediately sent up to date data to begin voting.</p>

											<h2>EventKit</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit" target="_blank">EventKit</a> is Apple's framework that allows access to a users calendar events. My Spot allows users to create an event for a spot which presents the user with an event sheet and certain data regarding the location is already filled out and set to the spot's location. EventKit also provides features for adding reminders or programmatically adding events without any UI but in My Spot, these features were not necessary.</p>

											<h2>WatchKit</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/" target="_blank">WatchKit</a> is Apple's framework for creating WatchOS apps. My Spot has a watch app that uses SwiftUI and luckily most SwiftUI views play very nicely with WatchKit. My Spot also uses WatchConnectivity which allows for the connection of a user's iPhone and Apple Watch. This connection is used when a spot is saved from the Apple watch. If a user is operating their watch and found an interesting spot near them, they can save it to their phone and now when they pull out their iPhone and open My Spot, that spot they were looking at on their watch is now saved to their device.</p>

											<h2>MapKit</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/" target="_blank">MapKit</a> is Apple's framework used to show location on Apple Maps. Of course this is a very integral feature in My Spot and is used heavily in the app. MapKit offers a SwiftUI and UIKit implementation, however, My Spot uses the UIKit version due to certain SwiftUI limitaions such as annotation clusters and satelite view. My Spot also uses local searches to quickly find a location with a simple search. For more info on MapKit's implementation in My Spot check out "Create Spots", "View Spots in Detail", and "Discover Spots" by scrolling up or selecting "Features".</p>

											<h2>WidgetKit</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/widgets/" target="_blank">WidgetKit</a> is Apple's widget framework for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. My Spot uses widgets with the user's location to show relevant spots near the user at any given time. The widget is updated once it is granted permission for location use or when the OS has determined that the user has moved to a new location. On tap of a spot the widget opens My Spot with a deeplink to show the spot in detail. My Spot's widget also uses intents to customize the widget. It can be customized to show the user's spots, or the location can be changed from the user's location to any location they choose by searching for a new location.</p>

											<h2>Messages</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/messages" target="_blank">Messages</a> is Apple's framework used to make sticker packs or iMessage apps. In the case of My Spot it is using the iMessage app extension to build a message app that allows the user to send their spots over iMessage. The extension is built entirely in UIKit with TableView + pagination to display all of the users spots and with a tap of any spot, that spot is sent to the message contents in the form of an image and the spots name/location name. If the spot message is tapped, a deeplink is triggered to open the spot up in more details in the My Spot app.</p>

											<h2>Mantis</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://github.com/guoyingtao/Mantis" target="_blank">Mantis</a> is a community built, open source, package available on GitHub. An issue I had with My Spot is I needed a way for users to intuitively crop any image uploaded to a 1:1 aspect ratio to keep uniformity throughout the app. Mantis was a perfect solution and very easy to implement. Mantis is implemented in the create/edit spot sheet, and create/edit account sheet. When an image is chosen from photos or from the camera, Mantis handles the cropping of each image in a very clean UI with solid unit tests and even localization.</p>

											<h2>WeatherKit</h2>
										</header>
										<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/" target="_blank">WeatherKit</a> is Apple's new api for iOS 16 to fetch weather information. My Spot uses this api in the detail view of eah spot. This is very useful for users deciding what day they should visit said spot. It allows users to check if it's too much rain to visit, or too hot. Maybe the user wants to go when it's the brightest out, well the WeatherKit api also predicts when the sun will be at its peak. And if there are any weather alerts in the area, My Spot will advise the user so they can make their own descision on whether they would still like to visit the spot or not. The weather object recieved in this api call retrives a large amount of weather data and My Spot uses that data to best inform the user on each day's weather conditions.</p>

									<h2>Privacy</h2>
									<p>Privacy is very important in My Spot. <br /> SPOTS: Any spot created that is not set to be public will only be stored locally on the device and to your private iCloud storage, and can only be accessed by the creator. Any spot uploaded as public will give access to anyone with My Spot to view and save. If a spot was uploaded by mistake, there are two options to remove it. Either go to My Spots tab and edit the spot and make it private, then save. Or go to profile tab, find the spot and tap the trash icon to remove it. You must be connected to the internet to remove a spot. I will never personally save any spots or collect any data, but once a spot is public any user can find it and download it.<br />  ACCOUNTS: Accounts are linked to your iCloud account and don’t require any signing in. No data is ever collected from your account and at any time if you would like to delete your account, please go to settings and scroll to the bottom where you will find the “Delete Account” button.
