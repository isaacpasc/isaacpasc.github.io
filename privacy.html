									<h2>Privacy</h2>
									<p>Privacy is very important in My Spot. <br /> <b>SPOTS:</b> Any spot created that is not set to be public will only be stored locally on the device and to your private iCloud storage, and can only be accessed by the creator. Any spot uploaded as public will give access to anyone with My Spot to view and save. If a spot was uploaded by mistake, there are two options to remove it. Either go to My Spots tab and edit the spot and make it private, then save. Or go to profile tab, find the spot and tap the trash icon to remove it. You must be connected to the internet to remove a spot. I will never personally save any spots or collect any data, but once a spot is public any user can find it and download it. Any spot that is added to a shared playlist is shared among ONLY participants of the share and never publicly uploaded to the cloud.<br />  <b>ACCOUNTS:</b> Accounts are linked to your iCloud account and don’t require any signing in. No data is ever collected from your account and at any time if you would like to delete your account, please go to settings and scroll to the bottom where you will find the “Delete Account” button. Upon deleting your account, all account data and comments made by your acccount are removed from the cloud. Note that deleting your account does NOT delete your public spots as well. If you would like to also remove all public spots you have created with your account, please make sure to delete your public spots before deleting your account. If you have already deleted your account and would like to also remove your public spots, you can always create another account (it's still linked to the same iCloud account so all your spots will be shown under the profile tab). Once you've created another account go the the profile tab and delete all of your spots then go to settings to delete your account once more.</p>
